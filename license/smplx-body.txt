SMPL-X: SMPL-eXpressive (hereinafter "SMPL-X Model") is a 3D representation of the human body that supports realistic changes in body, face and hands (hereinafter "body") shape and pose. SMPL-X Body is a subset of SMPL-X Model which excludes the shape blendshapes or the tools to create 3D bodies using the shape blendshapes of the SMPL-X Model. A SMPL-X Body contains a 3D mesh, a skeleton rig, pose blendshapes and dynamic blendshapes. A SMPL-X Body can be shared in the form of OBJ file(s), animated FBX file(s), or as a set of mesh vertices, skeleton rig, pose blendshapes and dynamic blendshapes in other appropriate 3D file formats.

The SMPL-X Model specification is a derivative of the SMPL Model specification (https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de). The latter is defined in the granted US patent US10395411B2 (published on 2018-11-01 and 2019-08-27, granted on 2019-08-27) and the pending European EP3314577A1 (published on 2018-05-02) and World WO2016207311A1 (published on 2016-12-29) patent applications, "Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model". The Max Planck Society (MPG) owns the technology disclosed in these granted and pending patent applications.

With this free CC-license, we want to encourage the adoption and use of SMPL-X Body and related file formats as a new Standard in 3D Body Modeling. The Grant of right qualifies as a donation under German law. As to § 521 Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch the donor is responsible only for intent and gross negligence.
